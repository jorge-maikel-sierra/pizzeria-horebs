Manage which WordPress Abilities are exposed to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Compatible with WooCommerce, ACF, JetEngine, and any custom post type. Enable or disable each ability individually from the dashboard.

== Description ==

**Enable Abilities for MCP** gives you full control over which WordPress Abilities are available to AI assistants through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Adapter.

WordPress 6.9 introduced the Abilities API, allowing external tools to discover and execute actions on your site. This plugin extends that functionality by registering a comprehensive set of content management abilities and providing a simple admin interface to toggle each one on or off.

= Features =

* **32 abilities** organized in 6 categories: Core, Read, Write, SEO, Utility, and Custom Post Types
* **WooCommerce compatible** — manage products, orders, and any custom post type with full meta field access (_price, _sku, _stock, etc.)
* **Admin dashboard** with toggle switches for each ability
* **Per-ability control** — expose only what you need
* **Secure by design** — proper capability checks, input sanitization, and per-post permission validation
* **WPCS compliant** — fully passes WordPress Coding Standards (phpcs)
* **MCP-ready** — all abilities include `show_in_rest` and `mcp.public` metadata

= Available Abilities =

**Read (safe, query-only):**

* Get posts with filters (status, category, tag, search)
* Get single post details (content, SEO meta, featured image)
* Get categories, tags, pages, comments, media, and users

**Write (create & modify):**

* Create, update, and delete posts
* Create categories and tags
* Create pages
* Moderate comments
* Reply to comments as the authenticated user
* Upload images from external URLs to the media library (with optional auto-assign as featured image)

**SEO — Rank Math:**

* Get full Rank Math metadata for any post/page (title, description, keywords, robots, Open Graph, SEO score)
* Update Rank Math metadata: SEO title, description, focus keyword, canonical URL, robots, Open Graph, primary category, pillar content

**Custom Post Types:**

* List all registered custom post types with configuration and taxonomies
* Get items from any CPT with filtering, search, and taxonomy queries
* Get full details of a CPT item including all meta fields (WooCommerce, ACF, JetEngine, etc.)
* Create, update, and delete CPT items with taxonomy and meta field support
* Get CPT taxonomies with their terms
* Assign taxonomy terms to CPT items

**Utility:**

* Search and replace text in post content
* Site statistics overview (now includes custom post type counts)

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.9 or later (Abilities API)
* MCP Adapter plugin installed and configured
* PHP 8.0 or later

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New** and search for **Enable Abilities for MCP**.
2. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
3. Go to **Settings > WP Abilities** to manage which abilities are active.
4. Install and configure the [MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/releases) plugin to connect with AI assistants.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need anything else for this plugin to work? =

Yes. This plugin requires WordPress 6.9+ (which includes the Abilities API) and the MCP Adapter plugin to connect abilities with AI assistants like Claude.

= Are all abilities enabled by default? =

Yes. On first activation, all abilities are enabled. You can disable any of them from **Settings > WP Abilities**.

= Is it safe to enable write abilities? =

Write abilities respect WordPress capabilities. For example, creating a post requires the `publish_posts` capability, and editing checks per-post permissions. The MCP user must have the appropriate WordPress role.

= Does it work on Multisite? =

Yes. The plugin can be network-activated. Each site in the network has its own ability configuration.

= Does it work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. The Custom Post Types section automatically detects WooCommerce products, orders, coupons, and any other registered post type. You can list, create, update, and delete items with full access to WooCommerce meta fields like `_price`, `_sku`, `_stock_status`, `_regular_price`, and more.

= Can I add custom abilities? =

This plugin registers abilities using the standard `wp_register_ability()` API. You can register additional abilities in your own plugin using the `wp_abilities_api_init` hook.
